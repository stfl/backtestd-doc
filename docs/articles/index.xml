      <description>Indicator Definitions The Indicators descriptions are defined with yaml config files in the config directory. /nnfx/config/indicator/{function}/{indicator}.yaml
The function of the indicator referres to it&amp;rsquo;s function within the algorithm. Like confirmation, exit, baseline, &amp;hellip;
Example config for ASH:

Algorithm Rules The algorithm rules describe how the signals of individual indicators are combined to make a trading decision.
The rules describe a signaling indicator and multiple filter indicators. The signaling indicator gives a signal and if the filter indicators agree to this signal, a new trade may be opened.
Indicators at the confirmation, baseline and continuation function act as signaling indicators. All other indicators act as a filter.</description>

      <description>When backtesting indicators or indicator sets there is a significant likelihood of curve fitting which gives good results for the specific backtested period but would not give good results in forward testing. This is also called over-optimization.
Filtering Over-Optimization Parameter Optimization describes that if the value of a Continuous Input changes, the result value must change proportionally to the input change.
Assumtion: based on Parameter Optimization
If the value of a continuous input changes by a single step but the result changes significantly, the results can be considered random and must be filtered.</description>

The ATR is a very important indicator in this system that is used - amongst other functions - for money management.
ATR
The ATR is the only pre-defined indicator in the NNFX algo.
Instead of the ATR, Standard deviation could also be used for money / risk management.</description>

The resulting metric for combined indicators must be larger than the metric for each individual indicator or indicator sub-sets.
This ensures that adding a single indicator to the set actually is beneficial.
Implications Indicators may not be compatible :PROPERTIES: :CUSTOM_ID: indicators-may-not-be-compatible :END: Good individual results may be bad in combination with other indicators.
Bad individual results may lead to good results when combined Bad individual results must not be fully eliminated but when selecting a candidate for combining with other indicators a weighted selection process should be applied.</description>

      <description>Definition The hit miss ratio Metric is defined by VP in Backtesting Step-by-step as win-rate.
This metric indicates if right after the entry signal price moves in our direction before it moves the other way.
We use the terminology hit/miss instead of win/loss.
 Here is what determines a win [hit] or a loss [miss], listen up.
 â€“ Start from today, and go back in time until you see your indicator give a buy or sell signal.</description>

      <guid>https://stfl.github.io/backtestd-doc/articles/20200820171402-side/</guid>
      <description>Indicator Side At any given time an indicator has a side that indicates long, short or neutral.
Typically if the last signal was a long signal the side of this indicator is long until the indicator gives a signal in the oposite direction. Same for short signals.
Some indicators also describe a neutral state.
Examples With a Two Lines Cross indicator with an up and a down line, the side is simply which line has the higher value.</description>

An indicator contains a specific mathematical function based on historical data and tries to predict future price movements.
At certain points the indicator gives a signal which indicates to buy/sell at a specific point of time and at a specific price level.
Each Indicator has various input parameters which change the behavior of the indicator. For example an input parameter of a moving average indicator will be the period on which the moving average is calculated&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>usually referred to as input.
Types of Input Parameters An MT5 Indicator may have different types of inputs
 Integer Float String Boolean (Bool) Enumerations (Enum)  Continuous Input An input is continuous if an adjacent input value only slightly changes the function of an indicator.
Adjacent input values result in a continuous result space.
Typically Integer and Float inputs are continuous.
An example would be the the period of an moving average.</description>

      <description>Kestner (2003)
 The K-Ratio is a statistical metric with an emphasis on consistency of returns, introduced by Lars Kestner in 1996 [1]. It has since then also been adapted by Zephyr Associates under the name &amp;ldquo;Zephyr K-Ratio&amp;rdquo; [2]. Having multiple different Equity curves, yielding the same amount of profit, the K-Ratio will prefer the curve with the most consistent gains (maximum smoothness).
Naturally, most investors also prefer a smooth equity curve over higher profits with deeper drawdowns.</description>

TODO Backtesting in Metatrader 5 New Indicators The optimization starts with adding and testing new indicators to calculate the metric for a range of Input Parameters. In order to filter (reduce) the result for further processing we analyze the results. The resulting configurations is referred to as Sliced Indicator Set.</description>

Peterson, Brian. (2017). Developing &amp;amp; Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies.
 Parameter optimization is important for indicators, signals, rules, and complete trading systems. Care needs to be taken to do this as safely as possible. That care needs to start with clearly defined objectives, as has already been stated. The goal of parameter optimization shouldbe to locate a parameter combination that most closely matches thehypotheses and objectives.</description>

 The profit factor is defined as the gross profit divided by the gross loss (including commissions) for the entire trading period. This performance metric relates the amount of profit per unit of risk, with values greater than one indicating a profitable system.

      <description>Reducing n n is the number of values of a single input parameter. /The lengths of the input sets are obviously not all the same but for O() notation this does not matter./
The size of n is defined by the number of possible values. The range, describing this has a start, a stop and a step value.
 If we reduce the move start and stop closer together. In case of a continuous input parameter the step value can be increased.</description>

      <description>After a new indicator is defined in the system it shall be tested. Testing means calculating the fitness function (metric) for each input parameter set.
The current implementation plan is to process all possible input parameters. This has \(O(n^m)\). \(n\) possible values per input. \(m\) different free inputs.
If an indicator has 10k input parameter and it is combined with another indicator of also 10k inputs the resulting search space is \(10k^2 = 100M\)</description>
