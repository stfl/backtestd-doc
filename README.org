#+TITLE: backtestd Documentation

This are my documentation efforts surrounding various concepts with [[https://github.com/stfl/backtestd][backtestd]] and [[https://github.com/stfl/backtestd-expert][backtestd-expert]]. It is written in Zettelkasten style in org-roam with links connecting the notes.

It is not complete and backtestd is abandoned so it will stay that way.
