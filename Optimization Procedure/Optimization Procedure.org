* Optimization Procedure
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: optimization-procedure
  :END:

The optimization procedure in this system defines the process of finding
a profitable configuration for the system according to the given
[[file:../NNFX Algo/Algorithm Rules.org]].

** Backtesting in Metatrader 5
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: backtesting-in-metatrader-5
   :END:

TODO

** New Indicators
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: new-indicators
   :END:

The optimization starts with [[file:Adding New Indicators.org]] and [[file:Testing New
Indicators.org]]. In order to optimize the data set for further processing
we [[file:Analyzing Results.org][analyze the results]] for [[file:Reducing the result
set.org]]. The resulting configuration is referred to as [[Sliced Indicator
Set.org]].

** Continuous Optimization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: continuous-optimization
   :END:

The previously gathered sliced indi set configs are then [[Combination
of Indicators|combined with other sliced indi sets.org]] by using various
[[file:Indicator Selection.org]] precedures.
