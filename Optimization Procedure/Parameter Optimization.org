  Parameter optimization is important for indicators, signals, rules,
  and complete trading systems. Care needs to be taken to do this as
  safely as possible. That care needs to start with clearly defined
  objectives, as has already been stated. The goal of parameter
  optimization shouldbe to locate a parameter combination that most
  closely matches thehypotheses and objectives. To avoid overfitting, it
  is also critical toavoid outliers, looking for stable regions of both
  in and out of sampleperformance. (Tomasini and Jaekle2009,
  pp.49--56)When a parameter or set of parameters is robust, it will
  have a fewkey properties:

- *small parameter changes lead to small changes in P&L and objective
  expectations*
- out of sample deterioration is not large, on average (see walkforward
  optimization)
- parameter choices have a sound theoretical or economic basis
- parameter variation should produce correlated differences in multiple
  objectives
