# Optimization Procedure

The optimization procedure in this system defines the process of finding a profitable configuration for the system according to the given [[Algorithm Rules]].

## Backtesting in Metatrader 5

## New Indicators
The optimization starts with [[Adding New Indicators]] and [[Testing New Indicators]]. In order to optimize the data set for further processing we [[Analyzing Results|analyze the results]] for [[Reducing the result set]].
The resulting configuration is referred to as [[Sliced Indicator Set]].

## Continuous Optimization
The previously gathered sliced indi set configs are then [[Combination of Indicators|combined with other sliced indi sets]] by using various [[Indicator Selection]] precedures.
