When backtesting indicators or indicator sets there is a significant
likelihood of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting][curve
fitting]] which gives good results for the specific backtested period
but would not give good results in forward testing. This is also called
over-optimization.

** Filtering Over-Optimization

[[file:Parameter Optimization.org]] describes that if a continuous input [[file:../Algorithm Components/Input Parameters.org]] value changes the result value should change proportionally
to the input change.

*The assumtion - based on [[file:Parameter Optimization.org]] - is that if a
continuous input changes by a single step but the result changes
significantly the results are caused by curve fitting and can be
filtered out.*
