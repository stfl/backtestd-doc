The actual quality of an algorithm can only be determined if all
functions are filled with indicators. At this point profit is a valid
metric.

* Combining
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: combining
  :END:

The resulting metric for combined indicators *must* be larger than the
metric for each individual indicator or indicator sub-sets.

This ensures that adding a single indicator to the set actually is
beneficial.

*** Indicators may not be compatible
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: indicators-may-not-be-compatible
    :END:

Good individual results may be bad in combination with other indicators.

*** Bad individual results may lead to good results when combined
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bad-individual-results-may-lead-to-good-results-when-combined
    :END:

Bad individual results must not be fully eliminated but when selecting a
candidate for combining with other indicators a weighted selection
process should be applied.l
