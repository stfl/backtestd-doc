The actual quality of an algorithm can only be determined if all functions are filled with indicators. At this point profit is a valid metric.

Combining
=========

The resulting metric for combined indicators **must** be larger than the metric for each individual indicator or indicator sub-sets.

This ensures that adding a single indicator to the set actually is beneficial.

### Indicators may not be compatible

Good individual results may be bad in combination with other indicators.

### Bad individual results may lead to good results when combined

Bad individual results must not be fully eliminated but when selecting a candidate for combining with other indicators a weighted selection process should be applied.l
