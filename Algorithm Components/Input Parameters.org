usually only called an *input*

An MT5 Indicator may have different types of inputs

- Integer
- Float
- String
- Boolean
- Enumerations (Enum)

** Continuous Input
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: continuous-input
   :END:

An input is continuous if an adjacent input value only slightly changes
the function of an indicator.

Adjacent input values result in a continuous result space.

Typically Integer and Float inputs are continuous.

An example would be the the period of an moving average.

** Distinct (Non-Continuous) Input
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: distinct-non-continuous-input
   :END:

If a distinct input value changes slightly, the function of the
indicator changes significantly. Adjacent input values result in
distinct results spaces.

Typically bool and enum inputs are distinct.
